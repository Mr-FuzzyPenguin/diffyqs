\section{Notes about these notes}
\label{notes:section}

This version of the textbook is for the Ordinary Differential Equations portion of Math 204 at the University of Victoria. This version is a fork adapted by Trefor Bazett of the original text by Jiří Lebl.

\subsection{Original Textbook by Jiří Lebl}

The original version of the textbook by  Jiří Lebl comes in three forms:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \href{https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/html/diffyqs.html}{The Web Version}.
    \item \href{https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/diffyqs.pdf}{A PDF}.
    \item \href{https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1706230230\}{A printed paperback on Amazon }.
    \end{enumerate}

Additionally, \href{https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/}{Jiří Lebl's website for the book} contain's a lot of additional information including the source code. 

Note that this forked version of the book for Math 204 at UVic is only available in web version. If you would prefer a .pdf or printed version, as of this writing the books are similar enough that you can certainly access the original .pdf or printed version with the above links. 

If you are an instructor,  \href{https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/html/notes_section.html}{please consult the original version of the text} for more information and potential uses.

\subsection{Differences between the versions}
As of this writing, the original text by Jiří Lebl and the forked version by Trefor Bazett are very similar. The most substantial changes in the forked version are embedding of a video series and an expansion of the exercises at the end of each section, with more questions, more answers, and some brif solutions. For a more precise comparison, please consult the respective github pages for the original and forked version. 


\subsection{The video playlist}
The full playlist of videos \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ9f-JfDG2WyBPsKFkkfszurhIYeKN6oX}{can be found here}, and consists of both Vector Calculus (not covered in this textbook) and ODEs (covering this textbook). The individual videos are embedded throughout the text. 

The videos are intended to be complimentary to the textbook. You could learn the content just by reading the textbook, as in the original version by Lebl. The other direction is not true; the videos alone don't always
cover all the content. Typically the videos use slightly different examples from the textbook so that you can get extra exposure by reading/watching both. While there was an effort for the notation and scope of the videos to be similar to the textbook, ultimately the book is largely written by Lebl and the videos recorded by Bazett and there are stylistic differences and differences in emphasis between these two. 



\subsection{Computer resources}

The book's
website \url{https://www.jirka.org/diffyqs/}
contains the following resources:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Interactive SAGE demos.
\item Online WeBWorK homeworks
(using either your own WeBWorK installation or Edfinity)
for most sections, customized for this book.
\item The PDFs of the figures used in this book.
\end{enumerate}

Jiří Lebl taught the UIUC courses using IODE\index{IODE software}
(\url{https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/iode/}).
IODE is a free software package that
works with Matlab (proprietary) or Octave (free software).
%Unfortunately IODE is not kept up to date at this point, and may have
%trouble running on newer versions of Matlab.
The graphs in the book were made with
the Genius\index{Genius software} software
(see \url{https://www.jirka.org/genius.html}). 

The \LaTeX\ source is available on github for the original version by Lebl (\url{https://github.com/jirilebl/diffyqs}) as well as the forked version by Bazett (\url{https://github.com/tbazett/diffyqs}) for possible modification and customizations.

\section{Introduction to differential equations}
\label{introde:section}


\subsection{Differential equations}

\begin{video}[KM3n22ZE8Bw][Intro to Differential Equations][introode]
    In this video we will learn the big ideas of differential equations. We will specifically focus on two, the equation for exponential growth and for freefall of an object in gravity.   
\end{video}

The laws of physics are generally written down as differential
equations.  Therefore, all of science and engineering use
differential equations to some degree.  Understanding
differential equations is essential to understanding almost anything you will
study in your science and engineering classes.
You can think of mathematics as the language of science, and
differential equations are one of the most important parts of this
language as far as science and engineering are concerned.  As an analogy,
suppose all your classes from now on were given in Swahili.  
It would be important to first learn Swahili, or you would have a very
tough time getting a good grade in your classes.



You saw many
differential equations already without perhaps knowing about it.
And you even solved simple
differential equations when you took calculus.
Let us see an example you may not have seen:
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 \cos t .
\end{equation}
Here $x$ is the \emph{\myindex{dependent variable}} and $t$ is the
\emph{\myindex{independent variable}}.
Equation \eqref{eq1}
is a basic example of a \emph{\myindex{differential equation}}.  It
is an example of a \emph{\myindex{first order differential equation}}, since
it involves only the first derivative of the dependent variable.  This 
equation arises from Newton's law of cooling where the ambient
temperature oscillates with time.

\subsection{Solutions of differential equations}

\begin{video}[wtnwuHdPMAw][The Key Definitions of Differential Equations][keydefs]Let's be a bit more careful with the definitions and ideas introduced in the first video. Along the way we will see a few different types of differential equations. 
\end{video}

Solving the differential equation means finding $x$ in terms of $t$.  That
is, we want to find a function of $t$, which we call $x$, such that when
we plug $x$, $t$, and $\frac{dx}{dt}$ into \eqref{eq1}, the equation holds;
that is, the left hand side equals the right hand side.
It is
the same idea as it would be for a normal (algebraic) equation of just
$x$ and $t$.  We claim that
\begin{equation*}
x = x(t) = \cos t + \sin t
\end{equation*}
is a \emph{\myindex{solution}}.
How do we check?  We simply plug $x$ into equation \eqref{eq1}!  First we
need to compute $\frac{dx}{dt}$.  We find that $\frac{dx}{dt} = 
-\sin t + \cos t$.  Now let us compute the left-hand side
of \eqref{eq1}.
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 
\underbrace{(-\sin t + \cos t)}_{\frac{dx}{dt}}
+
\underbrace{(\cos t + \sin t)}_{x}
=
2\cos t .
\end{equation*}
Yay!  We got precisely the right-hand side.
But there is more!
We claim
$x = \cos t + \sin t + e^{-t}$ is also
a solution.  Let us try,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\sin t + \cos t - e^{-t} .
\end{equation*}
We plug into the left-hand side of \eqref{eq1}
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 
\underbrace{(-\sin t + \cos t - e^{-t})}_{\frac{dx}{dt}} +
\underbrace{(\cos t + \sin t + e^{-t})}_{x}
= 2\cos t .
\end{equation*}
And it works yet again!

So there can be many different solutions.  For this equation all
solutions can be written in the form
\begin{equation*}
x = \cos t + \sin t + C e^{-t} ,
\end{equation*}
for some constant $C$.  Different constants $C$ will give different
solutions, so there are really infinitely many possible solutions.
See \figurevref{intro:plotsfig} for the graph of a
few of these solutions. 
We will see how we find these solutions
a few lectures from now.

\medskip

\begin{mywrapfig}{3.25in}

\caption{Few solutions of $\frac{dx}{dt} + x = 2 \cos t$.\label{intro:plotsfig}}
\end{mywrapfig}%


Solving differential equations can be quite hard.  
There is no general method that solves every differential equation.  We will
generally focus on how to get exact formulas for solutions of certain
differential
equations, but we will also spend a little bit of time
on getting approximate solutions.
And we will spend some time on understanding the equations without solving
them.

Most of this book is dedicated to
\emph{ordinary differential equations\index{ordinary differential equation}}
or ODEs\index{ODE}, that is, equations with
only one independent variable, where derivatives are only with respect to
this one variable.
If there are several independent variables, we get
\emph{partial differential equations\index{partial differential equation}}
or PDEs\index{PDE}.
%We will briefly see these near the
%end of the course.

Even for ODEs, which are very well understood, it is not a simple question
of turning a crank to get answers.  
When you can find exact solutions, they are usually preferable to 
approximate solutions.  It is important to understand how
such solutions are found.
Although in real applications you will
leave much of the actual calculations to computers, you
need to understand what they are doing.  It is often necessary
to simplify or transform your equations into something that a computer can
understand and solve.
You may even need to make certain assumptions and changes in your
model to achieve this.

To be a successful engineer or scientist, you will be required to solve
problems in your job that you never saw before.  It is important to
learn problem solving techniques, so that you may apply those techniques to
new problems.  A common mistake is to expect to learn some prescription for
solving all the problems you will encounter in your later career.  This
course is no exception.

\subsection{Differential equations in practice}

\begin{mywrapfigsimp}{3.05in}{3.35in}
\noindent
\inputpdft{1-1-fig}
\diffypdfversion{\par\vspace*{5pt}}
\end{mywrapfigsimp}
So how do we use differential equations in science and engineering?  
First, we have some \emph{\myindex{real-world problem}} we wish
to understand.
We make some simplifying assumptions and create a
\emph{\myindex{mathematical model}}.
That is, we translate the real-world situation into a
set of differential equations.
Then we apply mathematics to get some sort of a
\emph{\myindex{mathematical solution}}.
There is still something left to do.  We have to interpret the results.
We have to figure out what the mathematical solution says about the real-world
problem we started with.

Learning how to formulate the mathematical model and how to interpret the
results is what your physics and engineering classes do.  In this
course, we will focus mostly on the mathematical analysis.  Sometimes we will
work with simple real-world examples so that we have some intuition and
motivation about what we are doing.

Let us look at 
an example of this process.
One of the most basic differential equations
is the standard \emph{\myindex{exponential growth model}}.
Let $P$ denote the population 
of some bacteria on a Petri dish.  We assume that there is enough food
and enough space.  Then the rate of growth of bacteria is proportional
to the population---a large population grows quicker.  Let $t$ denote
time (say in seconds) and $P$ the population.  Our model
is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = kP ,
\end{equation*}
for some positive constant $k > 0$.

\begin{example}
Suppose there are 100 bacteria at time 0 and 200 bacteria 10 seconds later.
How many bacteria will there be 1 minute from time 0 (in 60 seconds)?

%mbxSTARTIGNORE
\begin{mywrapfig}{3.25in}
\capstart
\diffyincludegraphics{width=3in}{width=4.5in}{intro-plotbact}
\caption{Bacteria growth in the first 60 seconds.\label{intro:plotbactfig}}
\end{mywrapfig}
%mbxENDIGNORE
%
% Make sure to keep the above and the mbx figure below in sync!
%
First we need to solve the equation.  We claim that a solution is given by
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = C e^{kt} ,
\end{equation*}
where $C$ is a constant.  Let us try:
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dP}{dt} = C k e^{kt} = k P .
\end{equation*}
And it really is a solution.

OK\@, now what?  We do not know $C$, and we do not know $k$.  But we know
something.  We know $P(0) = 100$, and we know 
$P(10) = 200$.  Let us plug these conditions in and see what happens.
\begin{align*}
& 100 = P(0) = C e^{k0} = C ,\\
& 200 = P(10) = 100 \, e^{k10} .
\end{align*}
Therefore, $2 = e^{10k}$ or $\frac{\ln 2}{10} = k \approx 0.069$.
So 
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = 100 \, e^{(\ln 2) t / 10} \approx 100 \, e^{0.069 t} .
\end{equation*}
At one minute, $t=60$, the population is $P(60) = 6400$.  See
\figurevref{intro:plotbactfig}.

%mbxlatex \caption{Bacteria growth in the first 60 seconds.\label{intro:plotbactfig}}
%mbxlatex \end{myfig}


Let us talk about the interpretation of the results.  Does our solution
mean that
there must be exactly 6400 bacteria on the plate at 60s?  No!  We made
assumptions that might not be true exactly, just approximately.
If our assumptions are reasonable,
then there will be approximately 6400 bacteria.
Also, in real life $P$ is a
discrete quantity, not a real number.  However, our model has no problem saying
that for example at 61 seconds, $P(61) \approx 6859.35$.
%Obviously there 
%are either 6859 bacteria or 6860 bacteria.
\end{example}

Normally, the $k$ in $P' = kP$ is known,
and we want to solve
the equation for different \emph{initial conditions\index{initial condition}}.
What does that mean?
Take $k=1$ for simplicity.  Suppose we want to solve the equation
$\frac{dP}{dt} = P$ 
subject to $P(0) = 1000$ (the initial condition).
Then the solution turns out to be (exercise)
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = 1000 \, e^t .
\end{equation*}

We call $P(t) = C e^t$ \emph{the \myindex{general solution}},
as every solution
of the equation can be written in this form for some constant $C$.  We
need an initial condition to find out what $C$ is, in order to find the
\emph{\myindex{particular solution}} we are looking for.  Generally, when we say
\myquote{particular solution,} we just mean some solution.

\subsection{Four fundamental equations} \label{subsection:fourfundamental}

A few equations appear often and
it is useful to just memorize what
their solutions are.
Let us call them the \myindex{four fundamental equations}.
Their solutions
are reasonably easy
to guess by recalling properties of exponentials, sines, and cosines.
They are also simple to check, which is something that you should always do.
No need to wonder if you remembered the solution correctly.

\medskip

First such equation is
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = k y ,
\end{equation*}
for some constant $k > 0$.
Here $y$ is the dependent and $x$ the independent variable.
The general solution for this equation is
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = C e^{kx} .
\end{equation*}
We saw above that this function is a solution, although we used different
variable names.

\medskip

Next,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx} = -k y ,
\end{equation*}
for some constant $k > 0$.
The general solution for this equation is
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = C e^{-kx} .
\end{equation*}

\begin{exercise}
Check that the $y$ given is really a solution to the equation.
\end{exercise}

Next, take the
\emph{\myindex{second order differential equation}}
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2y}{{dx}^2} = -k^2 y ,
\end{equation*}
for some constant $k > 0$.
The general solution for this equation is
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = C_1 \cos(kx) + C_2 \sin(kx) .
\end{equation*}
Since the equation is a second order differential equation,
we have two constants in our general solution.

\begin{exercise}
Check that the $y$ given is really a solution to the equation.
\end{exercise}

Finally, consider the second order differential equation
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d^2y}{{dx}^2} = k^2 y ,
\end{equation*}
for some constant $k > 0$.
The general solution for this equation is
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = C_1 e^{kx} + C_2 e^{-kx} ,
\end{equation*}
or
\begin{equation*}
y(x) = D_1 \cosh(kx) + D_2 \sinh(kx) .
\end{equation*}

For those that do not know, $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ are defined by
\begin{equation*}
\cosh x = \frac{e^{x} + e^{-x}}{2} , \qquad
\sinh x = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{2} .
\end{equation*}
They are called the
\emph{\myindex{hyperbolic cosine}}
and
\emph{\myindex{hyperbolic sine}}.
These functions are sometimes easier to
work with than exponentials.  They have some nice familiar
properties such as
$\cosh 0 = 1$, $\sinh 0 = 0$, and $\frac{d}{dx} \cosh x = \sinh x$ (no that is
not a typo)
and $\frac{d}{dx} \sinh x = \cosh x$.

\begin{exercise}
Check that both forms of the $y$ given are
really solutions to the equation.
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}
In equations of higher order, you get more constants you must solve for to
get a particular solution.  The equation $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 0$ has the
general solution $y = C_1 x + C_2$; simply integrate twice and don't forget
about the constant of integration.  Consider the initial conditions $y(0) =
2$ and $y'(0) = 3$.  We plug in our general solution and solve for the
constants:
\begin{equation*}
2 = y(0) = C_1 \cdot 0 + C_2 = C_2, \qquad
3 = y'(0) = C_1 .
\end{equation*}
In other words, $y = 3x + 2$ is the particular solution we seek.
\end{example}


An interesting note about $\cosh$:  The graph of $\cosh$ is the exact shape
of a hanging chain.  This shape is called
a \emph{\myindex{catenary}}.
Contrary to popular belief this is not a
parabola.  If you invert the graph of $\cosh$, it is also the ideal arch for
supporting its weight.
For example, the gateway arch in Saint Louis is an inverted graph of
$\cosh$---if it were just a parabola it might fall.  The formula
used in the design is
inscribed inside the arch:
\begin{equation*}
y = -127.7 \; \textrm{ft} \cdot \cosh({x / 127.7  \; \textrm{ft}}) + 757.7 \;
\textrm{ft} .
\end{equation*}

\section{Classification of differential equations}
\label{classification:section}

There are many types of differential equations, and we classify them into
different categories based on their properties.  Let us quickly go over
the most basic classification.  We already saw the distinction
between ordinary and partial differential equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\emph{Ordinary differential equations}
\index{Ordinary differential equations}\index{ODE} or (ODE) are
equations where the derivatives are taken with respect to only one variable.
That is, there is only one independent variable.
\item
\emph{Partial differential equations}
\index{Partial differential equations}\index{PDE} or (PDE) are
equations that depend on partial derivatives of several variables.
That is, there are several independent variables.
\end{itemize}

Let us see some examples of ordinary differential equations:
\begin{align*}

\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} . & & 
\text{(Wave equation in 2 dimensions\index{wave equation in 2 dimensions})}
\end{align*}

If there are several equations working together, we have a so-called
\emph{\myindex{system of differential equations}}.  For example,
\begin{equation*}
y' = x , \qquad x' = y
\end{equation*}
is a simple system of ordinary differential equations.
\myindex{Maxwell's equations} for electromagnetics,
\begin{align*}
& \nabla \cdot \vec{D} = \rho, & & \nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0 , \\
& \nabla \times \vec{E} = - \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}, &
& \nabla \times \vec{H} = \vec{J} + \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t} ,
\end{align*}
are a system of partial differential equations. 
The divergence operator $\nabla \cdot$ and the
curl operator $\nabla \times$ can be written out in partial derivatives of
the functions involved in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ variables.

\medskip

The next bit of information is the \emph{\myindex{order}} of the
equation (or system).  The order is simply the order of the largest
derivative that appears.  If the highest derivative that appears is
the first derivative, the equation is of first order.  If the highest
derivative that appears is the second derivative, then the equation is of second
order.  For example, Newton's law of cooling above is a first order
equation, while the mechanical vibrations equation is a second order equation.
The equation governing transversal vibrations in a beam,
\begin{equation*}
a^4 \frac{\partial^4 y}{\partial x^4} + \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2} = 0,
\end{equation*}
is a fourth order partial differential equation.  It is
fourth order as at least one derivative is the fourth derivative.  It
does not matter that the derivative in $t$ is only of second order.

In the first chapter, we will start attacking first order ordinary
differential equations, that is, equations of the form $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x,y)$.
In general, lower order equations are easier to work with and have simpler
behavior, which is why we start with them.

\medskip

We also distinguish how the dependent variables appear in the equation (or
system).  In particular, we say an equation is
\emph{linear}\index{linear equation} if the
dependent variable (or variables) and their derivatives appear linearly,
that is only as first powers, they are not multiplied together, and no other functions of the dependent
variables appear.  In other words, the equation is a sum of terms,
where each term is
some function of the independent variables
or 
some function of the independent variables
multiplied by a dependent variable
or its derivative.
Otherwise, the equation is called
\emph{nonlinear}\index{nonlinear equation}.
For example,
an ordinary differential equation is linear if it can be
put into the form
\begin{equation} \label{classification:eqlingen}
a_n(x) \frac{d^n y}{dx^n} + 
a_{n-1}(x) \frac{d^{n-1} y}{dx^{n-1}} + 
\cdots
+
a_{1}(x) \frac{dy}{dx}
+
a_{0}(x) y = b(x) .
\end{equation}
The functions $a_0$, $a_1$, \ldots, $a_n$ are called the
\emph{\myindex{coefficients}}.
The equation is allowed to depend arbitrarily on the independent variable.
So 
\begin{equation} \label{classification:eqlinex}
e^x \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 
\sin(x) \frac{d y}{dx} + 
x^2 y
=
\frac{1}{x}
\end{equation}
is still a linear equation as $y$ and its derivatives only appear linearly.

All the equations and systems above as examples are linear.  
It may not be immediately obvious for Maxwell's equations unless you write out
the divergence and curl in terms of partial derivatives.  Let us see some
nonlinear equations.  For example \myindex{Burger's equation},
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} + 
y \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} =
\nu \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} ,
\end{equation*}
is a nonlinear second order partial differential equation.  It is nonlinear
because $y$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ are multiplied together.
The equation
\begin{equation} \label{classification:eqnonlinode}
\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2
\end{equation}
is a nonlinear first order differential equation as there is a second power of
the dependent variable $x$.

\medskip

A linear equation may further be called \emph{\myindex{homogeneous}} if
all terms depend on the dependent variable.  That is, if no
term is a function of the independent variables alone.  Otherwise, the
equation is called \emph{\myindex{nonhomogeneous}} or
\emph{\myindex{inhomogeneous}}.  For example,
the exponential growth equation, the wave equation, or the transport equation above
are homogeneous. The mechanical vibrations equation above is nonhomogeneous
as long as $f(t)$ is not the zero function.  Similarly, if the ambient temperature $A$ is nonzero,
Newton's law of cooling is nonhomogeneous.
A homogeneous linear ODE can be put into the form
\begin{equation*}
a_n(x) \frac{d^n y}{dx^n} + 
a_{n-1}(x) \frac{d^{n-1} y}{dx^{n-1}} + 
\cdots
+
a_{1}(x) \frac{dy}{dx}
+
a_{0}(x) y = 0 .
\end{equation*}
Compare to \eqref{classification:eqlingen} and notice there is no
function $b(x)$.

\medskip

If the coefficients of a linear equation are actually constant functions,
then the equation is said to have
\emph{constant coefficients}\index{constant coefficient}.
The coefficients are the functions multiplying the dependent
variable(s) or one of its derivatives, not the function $b(x)$ standing alone.
A constant coefficient nonhomogeneous ODE is an equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
a_n \frac{d^n y}{dx^n} + 
a_{n-1} \frac{d^{n-1} y}{dx^{n-1}} + 
\cdots
+
a_{1} \frac{dy}{dx}
+
a_{0} y = b(x) ,
\end{equation*}
where $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are all constants,
but $b$ may depend on 
the independent variable $x$.
The mechanical vibrations equation
above is a constant coefficient nonhomogeneous second order ODE\@.
The same nomenclature applies to PDEs, so the transport equation,
heat equation and wave equation are all examples of constant coefficient
linear PDEs.

\medskip

Finally, an equation (or system) is called \emph{\myindex{autonomous}}
if the equation does not depend on the independent variable.
For autonomous ordinary differential equations, the
independent variable is then thought of as time.  Autonomous equation
means an equation that does not change with time.
For example, Newton's law of cooling is autonomous, so is equation
\eqref{classification:eqnonlinode}.  On the other hand, mechanical
vibrations or 
\eqref{classification:eqlinex} are not autonomous.
